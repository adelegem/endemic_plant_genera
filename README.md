# endemic_plant_genera
An html document showing analysis of data (found in data folder) to produce a register of endemic plant genera, assess traits and threat assess, and map distribution can be found in this repository. 

A quarto document is also available to run these analyses uses data from the 'data' folder, however some datasets (ALA occurence points, WCVP file) will need to be locally downloaded. Links to these can be found within the 'data' folder in the relevant folders.
